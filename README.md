# Overview

Engineered Frontend through React.js framework:
1. Dynamically renders bank account transactions, option to save each transaction
2. Saves Transaction snapshots (ten transactions) and displays 5 of the most recent snapshots
3. Displays saved transactions as a list

The application calls the Up_APP_BACK to obtain the transaction information:
